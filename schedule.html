    <h2> Here is a further explination into each activity for further understanding:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeding time requires the mixture and feed and suppliments. Alfafa hay is also broken in to what is called
            "flakes" and each horse gets their own flake and bucket of specalized feed! This takes roughly an hour to
            mix, sort, and distribute to each horse.</li>
        <li>Grooming is also time consuming as it also requires individual assessment of each one. This can include
            caring for the hooves, baths, oiling of the mane and hooves, bug spray, detangling, etc!</li>
        <li>Exercise can be tacking up and riding your horse in a structured regimine or work from the ground. There are
            many training and conditioning tools such as: walker, round pen, hydro-treadmills, lung whips, and so on!
            This is a on an individual basis and the needs/goals of what you are hoping to accomplish with your equine
            partner!</li>
        <li>Cool down time is also very important as the exericise! You want to stretch and cool off your horse
            afterwards to aid in muscle building and recovery. This also prevents any twisted guts and serious injury to
            your animal. </li>
    </ul>
