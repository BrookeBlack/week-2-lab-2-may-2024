    <h2>About my favorite hobby</h2>
    <p>Horse riding has long been my favorite activity, even before I actually knew how! I am a <em>"horse girl"</em> at
      heart!
      I grew up watching tons of trainers on tv and the rodeo channel! I was totally in awe over the companionship these
      riders had with their horses.
      I chose to grow up and emulate that in every way I could and bring my <strong>passion</strong> to the table. I
      started out with the same horse I actually still have to this day!
      I hope that my style of training can be something to be aspired of as well by my children.</p>
